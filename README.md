# python-automation
for CYB333

## Project Goals
To build a script that can find all JPEG/PNG images in a directory/folder and convert it to PNG/JPEG.

## The problem you are solving (i.e. automate data extraction from a pcap file).
Automating image conversion within directories. If converting from PNG to JPEG, it reduces the amount of space the file takes up.
It also deters users from log onto a third party site to convert the image and potentially contracting a virus or exposing their accounts to malware.
File conversions can be paired with automated email scripts to send small JPEG files.
While this may be a very minor part of security, there are users out there who may not be educated in how third party, browser based converters are vulnerable.
Some files are trasnferred over unsecured networks for conversion, or users may download a corrupted/infected file.
This will also promote secure file sharing between users. If all conversions are done via script, then there is no questioning the file's integrity after conversion.

## Expected outcomes and deliverable
The expected outcome is for the script to list all readable PNG/JPEG files in the directory.
Then it will convert the files to the other.
For the sake of the script, I did a JPEG to PNG.
